## Empty State Dashboard

1. I modified alot of the components to receive props.
2. Check one more time if goals should not be there if the user did not set any goals
3. Should clicking on the accounts itself pop out the spending data found
   1. I think it should be yes.
   2. No it should lead to `add accounts`
4. Confirm that on the `myfi_onboarding_add_accounts` screen, clicking the banner doesn't do anything.
5. Should `Demo Dashboard` be changed to `User Dashboard` in design?
6. Also should the `feedback` icon remain?
