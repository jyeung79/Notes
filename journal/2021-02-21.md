## Priorities

For these next 4 weeks, (Feb 21st - Mar 21st) I'll focus on only a couple things in descending priority.

1. Polyphasic Sleep: Stick to the schedule strictly
2. Fasting: 40 days of lent
3. Full Stack Open: Work on the course

(To be honest I'm caught between Full Stack Open or kPics project)
kPics project may be harder because it requires a lot of thinking and research which may be difficult during this time. I rather just follow material to learn and stuff.
