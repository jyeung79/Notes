## Questions?

1. Question 1
2. Question 2

## Observations

1. Observation 1
2. Observation 2


## Weekly Meeting
* Upgrade Ruby gems
* boroDrive Plaid API
  * Upgrade to newest Plaid API using Oauth tokens
  * Borodrive was using the older version of API


* no spending data on trend mutation

## Dashboard Screen Empty

1. What is `myboroConnect`?
   1. `myboroConnect` detemines if the accounts have been connected
   2. Can we set this in the db?
   3. `check_if_myboro_connected` sets to true when `myfinance_status` is `show_analysis`
      1. Initially `myBoro` wasn't supported for all states
      2. `join_waitlist` for any user
      3. `onboarding` -> `show_analysis`
      4. Explicitly enroll `myboro`
         1. myboro shows analysis
   4. Temporary set `ankita.testdecline2@sjsu.edu` `myfinance_status` to be `show_analysis`

2. Why does `trend.length > 0`? Does it have to do with an empty [] means the trend data didn't load?
   1. It shouldn't be based on `trend.length`. Instead the demo dashboard should only show up when `myboroConnect` is `false`
   2. `loading` should just return `dashboardLoading`

3. Why is `goal` being returned as a string of a `array of goals objects` instead of `goals[]`?

^ Should we do any optimizations? Especially it seems like a lot of the computations can be offloaded to the BE.

Otherwise, what should I do with the `No Spending Data Card`?
* I can modify `DashboardSpendingCard` to have another state with no spending data

* it seems like `myfi_onboarding_add_account` doesn't look the same as design

## Insights Tab

Different tab `Actions.jump`
* Want to see the tab so use `jump` instead of `push`
Transactions `Actions.push(insights_analysis)`


analytics -> messaging -> transactions

Add empty screen without insights
