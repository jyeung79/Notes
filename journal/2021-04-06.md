   1. See if we need to use `navigate` instead of `push` to `reviewinfo`

## Dev Standup

Create a reader/writer through the database
RTS/Postgres - cluster that reads/writes
Cluster contains readers/writers
- Readers
- Writers
- Less traffic/less writer node
* Postgres version for Rey not upgrading to 9.16 (latest)

What is the tuning on SQS/AWS
* Load balancer on error on linking service

### Questions
1. How do we handle passing in previous `SSN` on the`ReapplySSNScreen`?
   1.  Do we prefill out the SSN on the Reapply Screen
   2.  If I pass in no SSN or empty SSN, then it won't update SSN info in the backend.
**Ans: **
2. Show the simple flow of the `ReviewInfo`
   1. Check if the validators should show the same as filled in text with no errors

What is the difference between rendering a `back button` from `react-router-flux` than using our own component `<BackButton />`

* Why doesn't the validator work for name, dob and such
  * Checked for the `<ReapplyScreen>` component in the DOM tree
  * Validator shows that `firstName, middleName and lastName` are all true
  * Guessing it doesn't update to check or something
  * Placing `forceUpdate` rerender works (unnoticeable)

## Meeting Notes Payment System

Meeting Time: 2021

Adding a sectino where you can add actions to delay payments without disrupting the other widgets on the screen
* Keep the actions simple

Main Discussion:
3 day delay
* To have a future payment once we have a future payment will we still be able to show nextPayment as the future payment
* Because of customer perspective, they should still see the next payment in 3 days?
* We can solve it when they delay the payment, can use it as a flag to be the delayed payment
* Admin will schedule future payments without seeing it as next payment
* Change the API to include future payments
