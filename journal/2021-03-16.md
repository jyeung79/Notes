1. Nevermind I get it. Only look at the `processor: expo` messages?
   1. Where do these messages gets created? **Forgot to ask**
2. Shouldn't `insightType` be another array? **New Design**
3. Ask about clarifying the different fields in Testdata **Yes no need for alert, link paths**
4. Ask about the date string? Shouldn't it be in GraphQL ISO time or something? **Forgot to ask**
5. We need to add category into the insights for the icons **This will be from BE**
6. What does the two arrays means? Object within an object? **No need for section headers**
7. How do we register if a notification is clicked? Are we just sending mutations each time a notification is clicked? Seems like a waste. **Yes**

## Things To Do:
1. Change `<SectionList>` to a `<FlatList>` no more section headers
2. Reorganize `InsightsAssets`
3. Setup a Query for `GetNotificationInsights(limit: 10, offset: 0)`

## Connection - Pagination

The library we are using on the Ruby BE is [Graphql Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/pagination/connection_concepts)

[Pagination by Connections](https://graphql-ruby.org/pagination/connection_concepts)

[GraphQL Pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/)

1. What is a generic?
2. Cursor exists on the `edges {node object}`
3. What does it mean when you have the `cursor` based 
   1. `friends(first:2 after:$friendCursor)`
```GraphQL
{
  hero {
    name
    friends(first:2) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
        }
        cursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```
