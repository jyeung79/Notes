## Importance of writing tests

[SO Comment](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/322256/time-difference-between-developing-with-unit-tests-vs-no-tests)

To summarize, writing tests and fixing bugs require time. Writing tests providers long term benefits such as documentation and refactoring. There will be bugs but less so with tests. Time is transferred from bug fixing to test writing.

## Full stack react Testing

Testing with Jest
1. Test runner - run on CLI to find test, run them and report them
2. Domain Specific Language (DSL)
3. Assertion library

Jest uses **Jasmine's assertion library**

### toBe vs toEqual

ToEqual is more sophisticated than toBe. It might have to do something with how it does shallow/deep comparison. 

```javascript
expect(true).toBe(true);
//toBe vs toEqual
const a = { panda: 'Millie'};
expect(a).toBe({ panda: 'Millie' }); // Returns false
expect(a).toEqual({ panda: 'Millie' }); // Returns true

```

### Shallow Rendering

Use `shallow rendering` which is to render only the virtual DOM representation. The actual react application maintains a VDOM to write to an actual DOM.

1. Test components in isolation
2. Faster than rendering, manipulating and reading from DOM
