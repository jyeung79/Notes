# Reflections

Read through the first two parts which are 
1. Structure
2. Inspiration

It's interesting to see that scripture is divided between the Old Testament (39 books) and the New Testament (27 books).

It's really interesting to see how the OT and NT divided into different categories of literature.

OT represents the old covenant that God made with the people of Israel. The NT is the new covenant made through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The new covenant is the fulfillment of old testament because of the prophecy of the messiah, salvation of his people and new transformed life.

## Inspiration

[[inspiration]]
There are many versions or understanding of the inspiration of the word of God but the author believes in true divine inspiration. That is, the Bible was written through the Holy Spirit in a person so that the writing is without human error and completely what God wants to convey. This means there is no transmission errors as the dictation inspiration meaning God dictated man to write all this nor inspired concept that God inspired man with divine ideas to convey. 

The inspired concept believes that just like how God inspires man through the Holy Spirit to teach, preach and to reveal things of God, it is the same way with scriptures. Argument against this theory is that teaching, preaching comes from already established word of God. There is a difference between expressing one's understanding of God's word introducing human interpretation than divinely inspiring without human interpretation of writing God's word.
