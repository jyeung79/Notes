## How to think in React

Let me read over this again. I'm not really getting it even though I read it once.

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)


[diff between state and props](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props)
`SetState` calls are batched. If you need to pass in the most updated version of state, pass in a function.

```javascript
setState({ticketsLeft: this.state.ticketsLeft - 1 }); // X Dont do This
//OR
setTickets(ticketsLeft - 1);
//INSTEAD
setState((prevState) => {
  return {ticketsLeft: prevState.ticketsLeft -1}
});
//OR
setTickets((ticketsLeft) => ticketsLeft - 1);
```

> `setState()` schedules an update to a componentâ€™s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

State should hold whatever local variables that would cause a re-render when modified or updated.

It also explains why `setState` is asynchronous.
> Ans: It's asynchronous because React waits for all components to call `setState()` in their event handlers before starting to re-render. This boosts performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

What I wondered is why can't `setState` just update without rerendering.
1. This would break consistency between `props` and `state`. *What does that mean?*
2. It would break new features

### Using Hermes

Can we implement Hermes now that we are bare workflow?

Hermes is an open source JS engine optimized for running RN apps on android. In iOS, RN uses JSCore. However, JSCore is optimized for iOS and runs slower on android.

Benefits include:
1. Faster loading times
2. Less memory usage
3. Smaller app sizes
[Worth Transitioning over in Android](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/79)

[React Native Hermes](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes)

1. RN >= 0.60.4
2. Modify `build.gradle` file
