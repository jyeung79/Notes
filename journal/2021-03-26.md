## To get the Rails Endpoints

All the API end points are listed in the `environment` file.

`URI_CONSTANTS` is the object exported from `app-constants.js` file where the function `getEnvVars` returns `ENV.dev`, `ENV.staging` and `ENV.prod` objects. Each object will contain the `API` endpoint for each of the tracking or such.

## App Tracking Controller

[Postman Body Data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-body-data)

The body is passed in as
```javascript
let body = {
      data: { event_name, device_id: Constants.installationId },
    };
```
and axios will pass in the body as a `json` object so the body field in postman should be
```json
{
    "data": {
        "device_id": "EE25C089-27ED-4916-94B0-337AB05A735F"
    }
}
```
