## Notes from NotificationInsights
#### 1. Where can I see where the node messaging system is? Is it the plaid service repo?
* Sends notification_ids and user_ID and push notifications it saves it.
* Pass in notification_id with the deep link

#### 2. How do I add pagination into the service using offset?
* query parameter is less than this and fetch the next limit
* setup Redis cache setup with rails
* limit(50*offset) <== Instantaneous calls

ArelTable join efficiently two table. Also provides pagination ability. We are not trying to paginate in rails. Sending data to react native.

3. How do I modify the DB with a Mutation?

#### 3. What does it mean that you have `context[:current_user].update_attribute` from `update_user.rb`

#### 4. What does it mean to `build`?
