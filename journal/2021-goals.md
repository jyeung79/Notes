# 2021 Year Goals

1. Get into the OMSCS - Computer Science Masters Program
2. Read 20 books this year incl. non-fiction (Christian or topics) and fiction (novels)
   1. [ ] Malazan the fallen - Deadhouse Gates
3. Create a Biblical Identity Course
4. Create an  Apologetics Course
5. Adapt to E3 (extended) 
6. Publish kPics app for Android & iOS app store
7. Go through React Developer Roadmap w/ Focus on React Native (Optional: Frontend Developer Roadmap)

## Need to Think Concretely how to achieve these below

1. Find resources to learn React Native or roadmap preview of what to learn
2. I want to get good at coding interview (Complete those timed challenges for Google/Facebook or FAANG companies or such)
3. What about the Church bulletin app or NBA Stats app?(Monetize it with ads)
4. An article per week? Per month (prob doable)? Per week will be much harder. Perhaps an article per 2 weeks. (26 articles by the end of the year)
5. Save enough to get MBP 16  M1X or something when it comes out (Budgeting and finances)
6. Make managing finances a priority instead of just w.e (This is important as I want to pay off my student loans and pay back my parents) Maybe I need to get rid of my credit card. Just go with Debit Card.
7. What about volunteering or such? Anything for the community? Tutoring for struggling students?
8. What about YT videos? I was thinking of doing Izone videos for now.

## Theres a couple things I want to stick to.

1. Make a task, project and daily work schedule to manage tasks or work ahead (Task management system)
2. Stick to writing weekly reports and trimester reports (Similar to earnings reports for companies)
3. I like including the notes for sleep or additional notes
