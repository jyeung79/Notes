The problem right now is having too many things to learn or focus on. It's like action paralysis. Too many things to do or choices renders you paralyzed inaction.

Immediately the most important as of this week:
1. Learn rails/ruby - Just focus on this for now. The others are extra icing to the cake

## Javascript Testing

Later on long term focus, is developing a Testing procedure or templates.
[Rules for Testing](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#section-0%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-the-golden-rule) - I haven't read it so I don't know. However, from what I read they give you good tips on testing and such.

[React Native Official Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview) - They also have an official guide on testing and such. Brief introduction.

[Intro to React Testing w/Jest and React Testing Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVBCpefQe8) - Seems like a good talk about testing and such. I want to watch the talk.

[Testing React Hooks - complete](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/testing-react-hooks/) - This is supposedly a (semi) complete guide to testing React. **Update: Read it. I disagree. The answer to not do unit testing or not testing implementation details is because function name changes or css names changes. When would you change it so much?**

[Jest Official Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react-native) - To understand the framework or library in-depth, you should read the docs. Or hey look at the unit tests.

[React Testing Jest - Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest) - I saw post and tutorials from this person before. They were pretty good.

[Live book of Tessting JS Apps](https://livebook.manning.com/book/testing-javascript-applications/chapter-1/v-6/) - Seems pretty in-depth and great guide to testing JS.

## SQL Learning

[Brief Explanation of SQL](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/databases/lessons/databases-and-sql)
[Learning SQL through exercises](https://www.sqlteaching.com/)
[Another interactive SQL exercises](https://sqlbolt.com/)
[SO summary of rails fundamentals](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5205002/summary-of-ruby-on-rails-fundamental-concepts)

## Ruby/Rails

[How To Study Rails Guide](https://www.sihui.io/how-to-study-the-rails-guides/)

Basically she goes over the basics of going through detailed technical documentation. Go over it slowly while being able to implement it or test it. Passive vs Active learning and such.

I do want to try implementing Storybook before we work on the new card component. That way we can test if testing is actually that much faster or quicker or easier.

Q: I still don't understand what is a MVC? What is a Model View Controller?
How does it relate to Rails?

## Ruby Methods
```ruby
def my_name
  "John Smith"
end
puts my_name

def greet(name)
  "Hello, " + name + "!"
end

puts greet("john") # Hello, john!
```

### Implicit returns vs Explicit

The last expression evaluated will be returned. However, if you use an explicit return `return` it will stop the rest of the method from evaluating.

```Ruby
def yes_or_yes
  if (false) return "No" # explicitly return "No" stops rest of method evaluating
  if (true)
    "Yes"
  else
    "Yes"
  end
end
```

### Predicate Methods

Predicate Methods have a `?` at the end of the method which is a naming convention for ruby methods that return boolean.
```ruby
puts 5.even?
puts nil.nil?
puts 'Hi'.undefined?
```

### Bang methods

You don't mutate your original variable but you can by adding a `!` at the end.
```Ruby
whisper = "WHISPER"
puts whisper.downcase!
puts whisper # whisper
```
