## Testing

[Testing React Hooks - complete](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/testing-react-hooks/) - This is supposedly a (semi) complete guide to testing React. **Update: Read it. I disagree. The answer to not do unit testing or not testing implementation details is because function name changes or css names changes. When would you change it so much?**

Also how do you know if your function works if you don't test it with corner cases? I just find the reiteration that don't do unit testing because your function name changes to be a poor argument.
