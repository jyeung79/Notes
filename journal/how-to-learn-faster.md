There's several points that I think are pretty good ideas.

### Context-based Learning
: Basically it means that to learn something effectively and retain the information, it should be based on context. Start by asking these basic questions.
* Why must I learn this?
* How can I use this?
* When can I use this?

> Having meaning or purpose behind what you are learning gives you context where your learning has relevance.

### TLDR; You learn better what you can use
* Prioritizing by Eisenhower Matrix. Know what is important and what is not.
