## Question

Fix issue with android notifications. Android notification requires setting Channels

```javascript
 if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
   Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('default', {
     name: 'default',
     importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.MAX,
     vibrationPattern: [0, 250, 250, 250],
     lightColor: '#FF231F7C',
  });
}
```

## Formik

Why use Formik?
1. Getting values in/out of form state
2. Validation and error messages
3. Handling Form Submission

What is going to happen with the creditdecline screens?

* Pass in the address as props from `ProfileScreen` or call a `query`?
* Do I `popAndRefresh`? Does that work?
* `AccountScreen` calls in `getUser` mutation and passes it as props into Profile screen

## Hebrews
> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinking of defiled persons with teh ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
> - Heb 9:13-14

## Animations in RN

[Explanation of Animations and Performance](https://formidable.com/blog/2021/reanimated-two/)

Our JS code runs on a JS thread and then communicates through a bridge to a Native Thread.

![](images/2021-06-04-08-40-40.png)

Performance cost in communicating over the bridge. Most cases, its not an issue. However, aimations may cause performance issues and start dropping below 60fps for animations. Users wonder why your application feels "choppy" or "laggy".

React Native - Animated API
- Library declare animations in JS and push it to the Native UI thread to execute
However, there are issues
- Limitations on what you can do
- Performance constraints
- Ease of implementation

## Reanimated 2

Replaces RN animated API providing Js based animation api easy to use and run on the native thread.

Reanimated will abstract all the details by a **worklet**.

> A **worklet** is a tiny chunk of JS code that can be moved to a separate JS VM and executed synchronously on the UI thread

Worklets are JS fns that get executed on the UI thread allowing us to define native-level animation commands without worrying about cost of the bridge.

Wow the article is really well-written.

**react-native-gesture-handler** allows you to handle gestures natively on the native UI thread instead of on JS thread.

## Reddit Thread on Reorg Manager

[Great article on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nrxe83/after_a_reorg_i_am_now_a_manager_and_have_been/)

## Change management

Change management is discipline of implementing huge sweeping changes across an organization.

[Great article on difficulties of change management](https://hbr.org/2005/10/the-hard-side-of-change-management)

Focus on both the soft and hard aspect of change management

### 1. Soft Factors
This includes
1. culture
2. leadership
3. motivation

### 2. Hard Factors
1. Project Duration
   1. Time b/w proj reviews
2. Performance Integrity
   1. capabilities of proj teams
3. Commitment of c-execs and staff
   1. of whom the change will impact the most
4. Additional effort of employees
   1. to cope with the change

DICE factors
1. Duration
2. Integrity

Effective managers of Status Quo aren't necessarily good at changing orgs.
- problem-solving skills
- results oriented
- methodical in approach b/ deal with amibuguity
- organizationally savvy
- accept resp. for decisions
- highly motivated b/ not crave limelight

## JWT WEb Tokens

JWT is not encrypted. The info is just encoded in Base64.

```js
// header: alg and token type
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

// payload: Data (No sensitive data)
{
  "iss": "dosh:dddddddd-dddd-dddd-dddd-dddddddddddd",
  "sub": "7f16dcf68ec1f0d1dd6c3165a55ba5db",
  "exp": 1590598276,
  "jti": "eeeeeeee-ffff-eeee-ffff-eeeeeeeeeeee"
}

// VerifySignature
crypto.createHmac("sha256", "your-256-bit-secret")
  .update(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload))
  .digest("base64");

//example JWT token
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJkb3NoOmRkZGRkZGRkLWRkZGQtZGRkZC1kZGRkLWRkZGRkZGRkZGRkZCIsInN1YiI6IjdmMTZkY2Y2OGVjMWYwZDFkZDZjMzE2NWE1NWJhNWRiIiwiZXhwIjoxNTkwNTk4Mjc2LCJqdGkiOiJlZWVlZWVlZS1mZmZmLWVlZWUtZmZmZi1lZWVlZWVlZWVlZWUifQ.RNDSifWcP5IMcmYybeh4cSBz8fBpOXYlpIKdtaUVTfw
```

The first part (`eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`) can be decoded in base64 to reveal. It's the same with the next set of strigns to the next `.`
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

What would prevent an attacker for impersonating the client? 
- Crypotographic signature from 3rd part. So you verify who it is.

## Vision Statement

What is the vision statement of the kBap app? Do we really need one?

### Journal About the Experience

What is my dreams?
Revisit strategies and invite God into this?
Where do you want to live?

Work don't give approval. God is my approval. Do your best? But don't seek their approval. They don't choose my identity

Co-create. Not boring and very synergestic

The key junction points. Few montsh and few years
Olympic runner

The company - 
emall group - leaddrship and dev

anointing & mantle
gifting
mantle - queen and king and in authority

Against the world success. God what dyou think

I was quite sleepy so I can't rmb everything so clearly. Basically I told them about my situation with my supervisor. He's a dick. Everything that I recommend as improvement he just dimisses. I told them I might be moving to Toronto too.

What was interesting as they were praying the Holy Spirit was revealing many things. Kai was then talking about coming to God and start thinking about 'What is my dream?' or to revisit strategies. All these things I'm like ehhhh okay.

Then she started talking about how God was asking 'Where do you want to live?' or something more in align with what about the place where you want to move. And I'm like what... I never even mentioned that I wanted to go to Japan or Korea at all. There was no way she would know unless if it was for the Holy Spirit.

And another things was she felt God saying not to seek the approval of my supervisor, my company but seek His approval. Like I never said anything about that and I know God was talking to me personally. It's not something you can bs. Well you can but inline with what I said, I never told enought abt that. They don't choose my identity. My identity is always in Christ.

Another thing was about how God has two different trajectories for me. Like two different paths that He wants to follow or partner with Him. And asking us to be co-creators with Him. He made us so we are co-creators, images of God. So everything we do we partner with Him. That's why He made man in the first place and gave man dominion over the earth. Mini-rulers. Something about it being exciting and not boring. I agree it's never boring with God. He always has something interesting in store. Synergestic?

There was also something about how being at this company would be something short term. Nothing too long and only a short while. But just do your best here. Also Kai was saying there's also this anointing over me as a leader or organization. Some skillsets or giftings that God given. While mantle is like authority or position, status such as King or queen that allows you to do something.

Something about key junction points. In a couple months and in a couple years? I thought that would be true because I'm making an app and it's like a different trajectory. But there'll be key junction point like an Olympic athlete and his start with the steps later on that build speed. Not letting the world define your sucess or how it views it. Let God define it.

In this all of this, I am reminded that God wants to partner with me in this. That there's two trajectories that can happen or go on. And that there will be two key junction points in a couple months and a few years. This is a reminder that we are co-creators or co-heirs in Christ. God doesn't just want robots and I don't agree with 'Oh it's all God's plan' Yes there are specific incidents that God wants us to be part of or be involved. However, I think it's more like God's asking us 'What do you want to do for me'. And it's like whatever that we want to do for Him, He can make it all possible. That as long as we have this dream or intense calling that we want to do something, He's like I can roll with that. Or more like I will use you for the Kingdom of God and do things that are even beyond what you expected.

God I'm really excited. You are never boring or mundane. You are an exciting, invigorating God that defies all expectations. Man's limited perspective cannot contain God. He goes beyond all our understanding. In all of this, he continues to shine brightly to reveal He is above all else. He is God, we are not. God I have alot of questions on what are the two trajectories or what should I do at the junction point and all this. I just trust in you and rely, walk with you in all this. It's more like you're walking with me. 

Even something like I wanna try living in Japan or Korea. You honor it. You know it. It's more like you don't have to respect that instead keep me in Vancouver or US to do your kingdom. Yet you so love me that you remind me 'Where is it that you want to live.' It's like God's plan involves our participation. Co-creators. I'm just so blessed and thankful that you listen to me. I just thought hey God I love you and I want to honor you. If you want me to stay here, I'll do it. And more and more living in Japan and Korea seemed more like a pipe dream than something I would actually do.

I know what God is talking about when you were saying 'What is my dream?'. I wanted to make an anime streaming platforms that directly connects Studios and their animations with consumers. They can get merchandise, support their favorite animations etc. Basically we would be a streaming, merchandising and logistics platform. My original goal was that I wanted studios to earn more money and to have more creative freedom. I see animators barely being able to make enough money to pay rent lest survive. It doesn't have to be this way. They're being exploited because it's "passion project".
