## Question

### Notification Service

`Routing` refers to how an app's Endpoints responds to client req.
* Listens to request at a specific route(endpt) and HTTP method
  * Executes a corresponding callback method.

[Pretty Good Explanation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

Also what is `CORS`? I still don't understand fully what it is.

1. What uses the `API` to send out notifications? How do we get these `notifications` or `context` in the first place?

`!!` - Why is this used instead of not having it in the first place? `notificationService L111`

`plaid_item`



## Ask Rey about the $0 Next Payment
Should it be paid_off state or disbursing state?
