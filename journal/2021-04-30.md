## Dev Meeting
1. Work on the AllCashOrders Screen bugs/issues
2. I need to figure out what I don't know and what needs to be changed/fixed
   1. Lakshay can we schedule a meeting on Monday? I need to think over it on the weekend.
   2. Meeting with Kylie & Isak on design. There's parts missing on the design or parts that aren't in the app.
3. I need to start adding tests to the AllCashOrders
   1. I'm going batshit insane trying to figure out what's wrong
      1. I don't know what's wrong: FE & BE. I don't want it all in my working memory.
   2. Lakshay can you take a look at the testing PR? The new libraries are dev-dependancies so they don't affect the final app.
