### What is a custom hook?

There's a testing library for it [react-hooks-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library)

Extracting component logic into reusable functions. [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)

So you can extract `useQuery` or all these hooks or stateful logic because in the end `hooks` and `components` are functions.

Before in class components we had to share stateful logic through `render props` and `higher-order-components`. Now `hooks` makes it easier by extracting it to a third function.

Wow this is exactly what I need to refactor the `notification` logic and `useState` or such logic. I need to change them to `function` components though. This makes your life so much easier.

## Linking 

Since `react-native v0.60`, linking happens automatically.

## react-native-gesture-handler

[react native gesture handler github](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler)

There is a library that extends the functionality of gestures in RN. `React-native-gesture-handler` provides native-driven gesture management APIs for buildign best possible touch-based experience in React Native.

With this library gestures will not be controlled by the JS responder system but rather tracked in the UI thread. Not only will touch interactions and gesture tracking be smooth but gestures/interactions will not be blocked by the JS thread.

I see a card swiping/card circling gesture that seems really nice to implement.
