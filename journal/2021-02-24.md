Kathy has an [Anxious Preoccupied Attachement](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship)
Basically when she feels unsure of their partner's feelings or unsafe in the relationship, they act clingy, demanding and possessive of their partners. Example is when I start socializing more with friends or spending time by myself, she thinks I don't care or love her.
