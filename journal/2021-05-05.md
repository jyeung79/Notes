## Questions

Is `pmt` supposed to be only monthly payments or whatever term payments?
1. Is it a monthly payment?
   1. `acardona.csub.edu` it shows that the amount_due

Name             |Value        |
-----------------|-------------|
id               |30991        |
user_id          |101729       |
status           |repay        |
amount           |1962.63000000|
pmt              |180.96000000 |
term             |12           |
amount_due       |90.48        |
amount_due_status|T            |
payment_plan     |2            |

Does this mean that this person is a bi-weekly payment?

Is this person then `PastDue` or still `Current`?

```ruby
def determine_past_due(amount_due, amount_due_status, pmt)
  return true if (amount_due > 1 && amount_due_status == 'P') || (amount_due > pmt + 1 && amount_due_status == 'T')

  false
end
```

1. WHAT? There's status `V` for disbursement? `Payments` table

## Another thing in `get_last_transaction`

[Ruby time](https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/12/ruby-time/)

display_transaction will be always true because the logic 
```ruby
  display_transaction = (DateTime.now.to_date - last_payment.created_at.to_date).to_i <= 2.days
```
Doesn't make sense.
2.days converts 2 days into seconds (86400)
So it'll always be less than 2
