## Question

### InMemoryCache

[Why Apollo Guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/why-apollo/)

* Each Graphql result object contains `__type_name` and `id`
* Make sure have `id` so it can automatically update queries that fetch the object with the same `id`

## Reanimated V2

[William Candillion Reanimated 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5ALKoP1m-k&t=49s)

Main part is `animation worklets`
- Seperate JS functions that run on a separate thread of main JS thread on the UI thread
- There's two threads
  - JS thread <-JS-Native Bridge-> Native UI thread
- Babel would convert the JS functions to be able to run on the UI thread

### Reanimated 2 Hooks
1. useSharedValue - Available to both the UI/JS thread
2. useDerivedValue - Computed from some worklet execution
   1. Deriving the value from some computation. Oh is that for more complex calculations
