## Small Group

1. QA on the web side login/account creation
2. 11:30am every day for DPD

## Questions Weds

1. Having issues with retaining `animation` location. It gets stuck at the initial location.
   1. Fixed it. Add `tabOne, tabTwo` which are distance of X to `useEffect` dependancies


2. Conditions:
   1. Should `password/phone/email` be cleared when switching tabss

4. What is `skip_user_confirmation`?
   1. `user.rb > line 170 - 173` doesn't get run because `skip_user_confirmation` is always true
5. For the new error message for unconfirmed. Do I need to modify anything for it.

## OnLayout

[Reactnative docs onlayout](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#onlayout)

Invoked on mount and on layout changes. Even fired once layout has been calculated but might not be reflected on the screen at the same time the event is received.
