# Questions to ask
1. What about NSF fees or charges on the `BoroAllCashOrders`?
2. Approve the `Fix future payment history` branch. We need it for the `BoroAllCashOrders`.
   
Uncomment A and b in `decide_user_flow` in `landing_question.rb`.
=> `test_group_variant` in user table

Be careful for `analytics_instance`

NSF fee. Who is in charge of compliance? I think this will be a major issue later on with a larger scale.

NSF fees are dependant on which state you are in? Based on different laws and regulations on NSF fees or late charges.
[Credit Karma NSF fee](https://www.creditkarma.com/money/i/what-is-nsf-fee) Basically the reason is that states limit the maximum amount financial institutions can assess. They can only penalize this much amount.

[NSF Fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nsf.asp#:~:text=The%20term%20non%2Dsufficient%20funds,enough%20money%20to%20cover%20transactions.&text=If%20a%20bank%20receives%20a,account%20holder%20an%20NSF%20fee.)

How about this? So the main issue with being able to specify the NSF fee or such is it's circumstancial. There's a wide ranging differences of fees for NSF or charges depending on Bank Institution and state laws. It's not simple enough to just specify or predict how much the fee is or cost.

So we can't deal with their NSF fees or such but what we can do it send reminders. (Need to clarify) I think we have something in place for 2 day in advance notice for payment. 

We're working on making sure to add notifications on upcoming payments or such. This will inform that we're going to start withdrawing money from your account. Maybe include something or some text to inform users that there might be charges or NSF fees if there's not enough money.
