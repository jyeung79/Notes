[ios14 iMessage Security Analysis](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html)

Referring to [[how-to-learn-faster]], answer the 3 Qs

1. I find it interesting to read about security and security exploitation/testing
2. Reading articles
3. Not sure

They use `Blastdoor.service` manages the parsing of all incoming untrusted data in iMessage. Essentially meaning, any incoming messages and additional attachments of external urls are processed here in the `Blastdoor.service.`

`Exponential Throttling` is a setting which increases the time a service restarts doubling each time. For example, if one of your services crashes, `launchd` which manages your services restarts it in 10s. After 3 times it doubles it and then continues to double the restart time to 20mins. This is to circumvent brute force exploitation of a service vulnerability.

Project Zero is a security research team that finds zero-day vulnerabilities and publishes research on it. It's to encourage and investigate common vulnerabilities so that companies can fix it or repair.
