## Flipper

Flipper is a mobile debugger that supports react native now. It seems to be ahead of react-native-devtools by a huge margin by support, plugins and easability.

Need to check it out

## React Native Changes (0.64)

[React Native 0.64 Changes](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/03/12/version-0.64)

Basically, iOS now supports Hermes as well. I do want to do performance comparisons or bug comparisons when using Hermes vs not. However, as of this moment, it is still in it's early stages (not beta) so most likely wait until next release when we try it out.

I do want to see the performance differences when using it.

### Inline Requires Enabled By Default

It seems like there's a feature called `Inline Requires` which is a babel transform that transforms this module imports to be inline.

### Performance Optimizations

I want to take a look into it more in-depth before mentioning anything yet. I need to do my own research and comparison.

## Offset Pagination is easier.

[fetchMore function](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/core-api/#the-fetchmore-function:~:text=The%20fetchMore%20function,-Pagination)

[Offset Pagination](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/pagination/overview/#input:~:text=This%20diagram%20shows%20offset%2Dbased%20pagination%2C%20in,number%20of%20elements%20to%20return%20(limit).)

How about setting up Offset Pagination first then adding Cursor(ID) based pagination later on.

It's easier to setup offset pagination than cursor-based pagination.
