# Friendship

It's a fact of life that your friends will change. Who you associate with will change based on priority. Instead, view your relationships as a pyramid. The ones at the top are few and close while the ones lower are plentiful but you don't know intimately.

| Rank | Type |
|---|---|
| S | God |
| A | Spouse|
| B | Close Family/Best friends |
| C | Church family/Friends you see occasionally|
| D | Casual Acquantaince |


The Bible advises on the importance of having good friends. You'll find plenty of Bible verses in Proverbs talking about the importance of being wise in making friends. Essentially your close friends (or Christian brothers or sisters) will influence and change you for the better or the worst. 

In fact, the concept of friends in Jewish culture carried a lot of weight. The ones you call friends means you associate with them and your reputation is tied with them. That's why when Jesus calls us his friends, he doesn't do it lightly. It means that he's willing to be associated with us and us with him. Like your reputation or your status is tied with who you call your friends. That's why the Pharisees mocked Jesus by calling him 'friend of sinners'.

### Friends come and go

The truth is your friends will come and go. Important friends that you had (B) turn into casual acquantance or occasional meeting time to time. That's just the way of life. As you and the other person's priorities changes so will your relationship with them change. 

However, most important are the friends (B) that are like a brother/sister to you. These friends are ones you:

1. Always feel safe to share
2. Honest with each other
3. Encourage each other
4. Share in each other's grief
5. Genuinely happy for your success or happiness
6. Trustworthy in what they promise

Those are the friends you should value and keep. Like you haven't seen each other for a long time, yet you instantly connect and share with each other all that has happen.

### My Experience

I have an old friend group that was quite toxic. Ever since the pandemic, I started hanging out with them more since I've known them for so long. Yet, I never felt safe to share. I always felt I was walking on eggshells and I felt they had toxic, negative and downright mean views of people. One of them also kept betraying my trust.

### My Advice

I don't know you or your friends. And it seems like it's a spectrum of good friend and bad friends. I suggest pray about it, read the proverbs related to friendships and tell God about it. Be friend with whom you want not because of guilt.

Also that friend that knows of your struggle yet told you can't be happy as you once were. Just cut them out. If they cared about you, they would be glad you're doing better. However, it seems that friend cares only about having a good time (hence "you're not as fun as you used to"). Don't be friends with them.

Otherwise, pray about it and ask God to help bring either mentors or to find brothers/sisters in Christ in your life. People who can speak truth in your life. Ones who can remind you of your worth and value. Jesus paid such a heavy price not because we were only sinful but because we were so precious to Him. Our debt needed to be settled and he desired us so badly he did it on our behalf. You are worth the blood of Christ not because of our actions/accomplishments but because he loves us. That is why we should not allow other people to degrade us or devalue us because of how God values us. You are worth too much now. Don't devalue yourself nor give other people permission. 

This includes making friends who care about you, value you, trustworthy and admirable. Be friends with whom will make you a better person or to be like Christ. Anyways sorry for the long rant. I'm sure Jesus will be with you throughout all of this. Of course, he's the friend that was always faithful and never foraken us :D He's my best friend and I hope he'll be yours as well
