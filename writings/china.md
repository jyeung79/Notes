# Talk on Sunday about China

Kedar brought up these points
* Riots not caused by students but police
  * Gangster bought by police to start beating people in new world
* Evidence of police inside protest groups
* Police start fighting with protestors?
* China bans right of freedom of speech 
  * Freedom of speech without harm to others
* China can make people disappear
* China imprisoned so many radical extremist
  * Forced them into reeducation camps
* Captured Huawei CFO but better treatment than 2 Canadians without Canadian embassy

I think there's an assumption here:
1. Democracy > Authorianism
2. China is evil while West is good

I personally dislike how people and nations demonize China. I really need to do my research on this topic.
1. I believe China is advancing in many areas compared to West (mainly US)
   1. Brought 800 million people out of poverty
   2. Provided more than adequate food/shelter for people
   3. Personal safety - You aren't scared going out
   4. Patriotism - general sense of unity towards country
   5. Health care is cheap
   6. Wealth inequality isn't as bad as Western countries
2. History tells us China isn't the nations that conquered other nations
3. Hong Kong under British Rule was worst off than under China's Rule
4. Look deeper into the Hong Kong riots and such

Why does no one talk about Singapore being an authoritian regime?
