Currently there's quite a lot of confusion going on. I just want to clarify on the situation for people from what I understand. If there's any thing else, please let me know and I'll add it in.

### What Happened?

There's quite alot of rumors on how the disbandment occurred. However from what we know, Izone was set to continue with an extension. All signs from media and the girls' responses that there was going to be an extension. There was no news on the concert being a farewell nor farewell/disbandment promotions.

## Rumors
1. Some of the companies didn't show up to renew the contract signing. It was reported that some of the companies decided to pull out last minute. The companies might have been agreed verbally but no concrete signing took place.

2. Another rumor is that all the companies agreed to an extension but CJ E&M delayed the signing. Companies came together in December to discuss about their suspicions. It seemed that CJ E&M did not intend to go through with the extension.

We don't know which of the two rumors are true or if there's additional information. However we do know what the response of CJ E&M is.

### How CJ Handled Everything

Whether either rumor is true or not CJ grossly mismanaged the disbandment news and the last 6 weeks before the disbandment.

1. If rumor (1) is true, CJ should've had a written formal agreement early on instead an verbal agreement. Relying on verbal agreements is a sign of poor business practices.
2. If rumor (2) is true, CJ had no intention of going through with the extension. Instead, they lead the companies to believe there was an extension.

There's so many rumors at this moment we don't know what's valid or not.

We can only assume that CJ EM treated the girls unfairly and threw the rug under them.

1. Announced disbandment news after concert ticket refund window is over.
2. Only informed the members a couple days before the concert.
3. Let the girls emotionally breakdown on live broadcast.
4. Doesn't do any farewell show/album/promotions in the last 6 weeks.

### Personal Thoughts

I personally believe in the theory that CJ E&M never intended to extend Izone. Perhaps they did but some higher management in the CJ conglomerate suddenly decided against it. Also it was highly suspicious that just a day after the disbandment news broke out, the news of Sakura planning to sign with Bighit got released. This was when the news about the final sentence on the produce PD rigging was released. It seemed like a calculated move to deflect anger against the produce scandal or to shift people's attention away from the sudden disbandment news.

I think the main motivation for CJ E&M is to get rid of the produce scandal associations. Someone higher up didn't want Izone to continue and be a constant reminder of the scandal. Also, Mnet is planning to have another girl group survival show, Girls Planet 999. This and coupled with getting rid of the rigging scandal associations, management decides to go on with the disbandment.

#####Tldr; CJ E&M is either grossly incompetent or plain evil. Anyways screw CJ E&M. Hope they crash and burn.
