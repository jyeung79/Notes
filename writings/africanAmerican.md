# Asian Hate

So theres a couple points after reading through this:
1. The driver in the article even says that this case might not be racially motivated. There was a fist fight going on and it was related to the passengers. Passengers got in the car and the group attacked the passengers and the driver.

2. There has been a lot of Asian rascism and hate crimes in America. There was some statistic that showed ~50% was from African Americans and ~30% from Latinos. News have been underreporting this in light of the statistics. This is a huge issue that media is hiding from us.

3. This rise in asian hate crimes might stem from harsher job market and rise in Chinese propaganda. In fact, it also seems like Black/Latino community after being oppressed so long is lashing out at another minority community. I would suggest it might stem from 1. A lack of financial opportunities and 2. Systemic oppression against Blacks in America. It's like how Trump likes to do it. Deflect the blame and hatred at others instead of really looking at the main issue.

Overall, both class and wealth inequality comes into play. I would suggest there's quite of things going on but what would improve it would be:

1. Start improving the education system in America. Education is usually correlated to higher wage, better working standards and job satisfaction. However not only improvements in STEM, but also in the Arts (History, World Literature, Philosophy, Finance? and others). When you lack a well-rounded education, you don't see beyond your current situation. You start discovering more about the world, more about other people's plight or your own and you understand the human condition. You see that the world is beyond just your current situation. "People who do not know history will end up repeating it" (Some person I dont know)

2. Change in Black culture. I'm not the most educated on this but there needs to be a change in African American arts/music. There needs to be a change from just victimization, gangbanging and "money" culture. Yes it is true there's is system oppression. Yes it is also true that Blacks should be able to express their frustrations and anger at society through music. But it should be towards a goal to reform society or to be conducive towards society. Right now, there's a mindset of creating division or rage against society or the police. We should build communities not destroy them.

Anyways, I don't know what I'm saying lol. Just rambling and trying to get my thoughts out. Steps are 1. Improve Education 2. Improve Wealth Generation 3. Build stronger communities (maybe?)
