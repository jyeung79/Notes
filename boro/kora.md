Thinking more on this. Kora could be this Cyberpunk, Futuristic, Neon AI app that aims to revolutionize banking for students. The brand image would be of Kora, a sassy, trendy, fierce and strong AI that helps your financial future. This would differentiate Kora from all the other stale and "sterile" fintech apps. You could add many gamificiation aspect as well.

I thought this idea was interesting so I brainstormed some more on this here.
