## Short Intro between each other

Currently I'm still brainstorming about the idea. Not too sure what to do first.

## Short Story

Background
1. I started liking Kpop since 2008 or so. There was the OG groups, SNSD, Shinee, Kara, Tara, 2pm, Super Junior, BAP, BTS (popular).
2. I have stanned groups from Snsd -> Twice. Others I like Itzy, Loona. Non-kpop Yerin Baek, Heize, Dean
3. I haven't liked any group as Izone. Izone really helped me to go through the 1 year of job-searching. Just watching them grow, perform and interact helped me get by.
4. Now they're disbanding, I feel heartbroken. Yet at the same time, I am thankful that I have gotten a chance to stan them.
5. To me, this project is my Thank You. Thank you for all the countless listening sessions. The bops that make me shake my head. The countless laughs from variety shows. Just plain enjoy watching them grow and develop as performers.
6. I want to give back. Not sure how it'll go or if anyone will use it but that's my intention.
