# Build Your Own

[Build Your Own ... List](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-bittorrent-client)

Has a huge list on all types of project tutorials in all types of languages.

Basically there's 2 main languages for projects that I want to work on
1. Javascript/Typescript projects
   1. Project learning instead of trying to learn language
2. Rust
   1. Server development and WASM
3. Java/Go?
   1. Java for Springboot and Backend Dev
   2. Go for server stuff
4. Python?
   1. Learning python would be useful for writing scripts, automation and etc.
