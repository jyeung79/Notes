# CS1000

[The entire CS curriculum shown here](https://cs1000.vercel.app/)

8 semesters of courses however, I don't really care about ML or DL nor self-driving cars or such. Semesters 6 and afterwards I don't really care that much about.

1. Semester 1
   1. [ ] Review of C
   2. [ ] Review of Python
2. Semester 2
   1. [ ] C++ and OOP
   2. [ ] Computer System Architecture (CSA)
3. Semester 3
   1. [ ] Probability
   2. [ ] Statistics
   3. [ ] Algos & DS
4. Semester 4
   1. [ ] OS
   2. [ ] Software Eng
   3. [ ] Advanced Algos
   4. [ ] Dynamic Programming
5. Semester 5
   1. [ ] Databases (SQL)
   2. [ ] Machine Learning (Try it)
   3. [ ] Distributed Computing

Not sure where to start tbh. I think the best way to learn is to learn content that is relevant to you. Perhaps I can start thinking about this later after adapting to polyphasic sleep because focus on trying to do too many things sets you up for failure.

Not sure where to start here. To be honest I don't really care about learning mathematics part. It might help me understand better but tbh I'll just learn it when I need it.

I noticed under specializations there's a part for [`Full Stack Open`](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

I actually want to do the [graphQL section](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part8) Perhaps after I finish the Apollo/graphQL example
