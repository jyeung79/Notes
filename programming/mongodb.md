# MongoDB

[HN: Do you still use MongoDB](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23270429)

Many things that seem to stand out to me
1. Parent company promised that it's great for all use-case
   1. Didn't disclose that there were a lot of limitations
   2. What were these limitations?
2. NoSQL is fast because Key-Value
   1. High storage overhead
   2. Every document you store has to detail its own schema inline
   3. Tradeoff: Flexibility vs Storage Efficiency
3. Schema as Documentation
   1. MongoDB lacks that
