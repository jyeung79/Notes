# Hoisting 

* Hoisting is referred as variables and functions being hoisted to the top of the code. Essentially they can be called before they are declared.
* Javascript engine parses the code to find syntax errors or such
* Then it sets memory aside for the variables or functions. 
* Variables are set to `undefined`
* Functions are entirely stored in memory
* Thus, functions can be called without issues before it is declared
