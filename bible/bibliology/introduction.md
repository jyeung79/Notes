# Bibliology

There's 5 main components

1. Structure
2. Inspiration (Where does scripture come from? Man or God or both?)
3. Accuracy (Is scripture trustworthy to believe in?)
4. Authority (Why should we believe it in the first place?)
5. Canonicity (How do we know the 66 books are valid scripture?)

Add another one
6. Historicity (Does the bible describe history? Not sure)
